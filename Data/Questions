# What question did you investigate and explain how it pertains to the project’s goals?

How the Covid 19 hit the different countries’ population differently

# What problems did you have while exploring & analyzing your data, how did you overcome them?

The fields that were blank and not having exactly the kind of data I was looking for

#What did you find along the way that you didn’t expect?

I’ve got some unexpected but interesting results regarding to COVID Deaths per million people and COVID Total Cases per Km2

# What were your primary findings on the question you investigated?

The charts show clearly

# Can any general conclusions be drawn from your analysis?

‘COVID Deaths per million people’ were represented clearly on a chart bar showing the discrepancy between countries, probably 
a reflex of their policy adopted against the pandemic. Sweden shows a high concentration of deaths per million, although it had only 
5933 deaths this country has a total population of 10,099,270.

‘COVID Total Cases per Km2’ shows an unexpected concentration of people per area, once the virus is highly airborne transmissible, 
which had an effect especially on UK and Italy, smaller countries compared to US and Brazil.

Scatter plots - ‘COVID Total Cases vs. Median Age (years)’ and ‘COVID Total Deaths vs. Median Age (years)’ both show Low negative correlation 
and Insufficient evidence against Null hypothesis.

# If you had two more weeks, what would you have liked to expand upon or look deeper into?

I’d like to obtain more and specific data regarding to age ranges affected by pandemic.

# Elaborate on your questions, describing what kinds of data you need to answer them, and where you found it.

Question 1:  How the pandemic affected a country’s population in numbers?

Question 2: Is the population density relevant during a highly transmissible virus pandemic?

Question 3: Is there any relation between the number of cases and population’s median age?

Question 4: Is there any relation between the number of deaths and population’s median age?

# Describe the exploration and cleanup process

Starting from the file owid-covid-data.csv, I kept only the columns of interest(Location, Date, Total Cases, Total Deaths, Population, 
Population Density, Median Age (years), Aged 65 Older (%)), then the countries of interest were kept ("China", "Japan", "New Zealand", "United Kingdom", 
"Italy", "Sweden", "United States", "Brazil") and then only the last row of each with the most updated data. I saved to a clean csv file owid_data.csv.

# Discuss the steps you took to analyze the data and answer each question you asked in your proposal.

Outside of the dataframe, I calculated the mortality rate per million people and rate of cases per km2 of area, for every country. 
They were plotted bar and scatter charts and I also obtained the linear regression for ‘COVID Total Cases vs. Median Age (years)’ and
‘COVID Total Deaths vs. Median Age (years)’.
